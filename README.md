COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project analyzes the global and regional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available datasets. The objective is to explore relationships between COVID-19 statistics—such as total cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage—and key economic and social indicators like GDP and the Human Development Index (HDI). By leveraging Python's statistical and data visualization tools, the project identifies trends and correlations, shedding light on the pandemic's economic and social consequences.

Highlights:
Data Preparation:

Cleaned the dataset using Pandas by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Created new features, such as total_deaths_to_total_cases, for in-depth analysis.
Aggregated data by continents to facilitate regional comparisons.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Investigated unique locations, continents, and key statistics (e.g., total cases, deaths).
Analyzed trends in infection and mortality rates across regions.
Explored relationships between COVID-19 statistics and economic indicators.
Data Visualization:

Visualized trends using histograms, scatter plots, and bar plots for better interpretability.
Highlighted patterns and correlations between pandemic data and economic metrics.
Deliverables:

A cleaned and aggregated dataset saved for future research.
Insights into the economic fallout of COVID-19, including impacts on GDP, employment, and market fluctuations.
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of the long-term impact of COVID-19 on global economies and societies, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and analysts.
